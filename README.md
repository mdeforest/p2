## 3 Unique inputs
(1) Text input to specify information such as First Name, (2) Radio to indicate what resume template to use (3) Dropdown to indicate the Day, Month, and Year of a particular event

## Class
`Form.php` and the child class `MyForm.php`

## Code style divergences
None that I know of

## Notes for instructor
I could expand on this project a little bit (such as putting in more templates), but for time I am keeping it at this.

I thought about creating my own HTML templates but chose to use ones I found online because I did not think designing Resume templates was a good use of time
